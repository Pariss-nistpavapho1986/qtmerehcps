Just finished Squad 36 and oh man, what a ride. Like, seriously, it's one of those movies where you feel so hyped up but also kinda drained, you feel me? The whole time I'm thinking, wow, this is gonna be epic, and then it actually is! Some parts are a little like okay, I've seen this before, but then bam, it hits you with something wild. 

I mean, the opening alone was like, woah. I almost spilled my drink, lol. But you know, some parts felt like they just lingered on a bit too long. Just me? Anyway, the characters were so on point, like that one dude, the snarky guyâ€”I totally see a little of myself in him. Not saying I'm a hero or anything, but you get it, right? ðŸ˜†

> Seriously though, the soundtrack deserved its own standing ovation! It was like every scene was a mini concert. But also... did they forget about the plot at a couple of points, or was it just me? Just so much happening and I'm like, trying to connect all the dots in my brain.

I'm still kinda wondering about that ending tho. Like it was all dramatic and stuff but also, could they have been more vague? I dunno, maybe they're setting us up for a sequel? Either way, I might just need to download the movie to spot all the hidden details I missed the first time.

Oh, and can we talk about that fight scene? I mean, I'm not an action junkie, but man that choreography was bananas. I couldn't even tear my eyes away. It just kept pulling me back in. But, haha, then you're left with these quiet moments and I'm like, it's 3 AM, I can't handle this emotional whiplash right now.

if (hypedUp) { drinkMoreCoffee(); } else { napTime(); }

Did they seriously leave out that subplot with the scientist? Like, what even happened there? Anyway, I kinda feel like Iâ€™ve just run a mental marathon. Maybe Iâ€™ll watch the movie again laterâ€”need to process, or at least let my brain catch up with reality. You in for round two?
